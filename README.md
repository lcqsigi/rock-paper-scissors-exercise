# rock-paper-scissors-exercise The details of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/lcqsigi/rock-paper-scissors-exercise/blob/main/game.py).The only requirement is `python 3` and there is no need to set-up a `conda`environment.To execute the code, open a terminal and type:```shpython game.py```Then type your selection in small caps:    1. rock    2. paper    3. scissorsAfter, the user types a valid choice the computer will also generate a choice and thecoded python algorithm will decide if the `user` or the `computer` won the rock-paper-scissors game on the basis of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).An invalide choice (e.g., Rock, rocks, rock2) will not be accepted by thecoded python algorithm.
